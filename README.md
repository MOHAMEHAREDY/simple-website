ðŸ’¡ From Idea to Deployment: My Web Development Journey

Iâ€™m excited to share my experience of creating a simple project using HTML and CSS and turning it into a fully deployed application with DevOps tools. The journey began with building a clean and elegant user interface. I then used Docker to containerize the project, utilizing Nginx as a web server to serve the files professionally.

ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Journey
Instead of pushing the Docker image to Docker Hub, I opted to run it locally using Minikube. I created Kubernetes Deployment and Service files to orchestrate the application and ensure high availability.

ðŸ”§ Skills in Action

Building and managing Docker images.
Deploying applications on Kubernetes with Minikube.
Leveraging Nginx for serving static content.
This experience allowed me to understand the full lifecycle of applications, from development to deployment, and how DevOps tools can streamline application management and operations in an efficient environment.

Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts, feedback, or any advice for improving future projects! ðŸ˜Š
